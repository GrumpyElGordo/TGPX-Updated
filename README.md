TGPX is a popular TGP script for running TGP Sites.

It used to be commercial software but was released into the public domain once the creator
decided to abandon further development. This left several bugs which prevented the script
from working with newer versions of PHP. 

We have updated the code to be compatible with PHP 5.5.
