<br />
<br />

TGPX allows you to create an unlimited number of TGP pages to display your galleries.  This document will describe how you can add, update, and remove the TGP pages that
TGPX will be building.

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
While TGPX does not set a limit on the number of TGP pages you can configure, your server configuration will be a limiting factor.  If you plan on having a very large number
of TGP pages generated by TGPX (500+) it is highly recommended that you have a high-end dedicated server.
</div>

<br />

<b class="heading">Searching/Viewing TGP Pages<a name="search"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To view the currently configured TGP pages so you can modify or delete them, access the TGP Pages &gt; Manage Pages function from the control panel menu.  This will display a 
page where you will be able to see all of the currently configured TGP Pages and search them if necessary.

<br />
<br />

In the table that displays the TGP pages you have configured, you will find several functions that you can run on a single TGP page at a time.  Each of those functions are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/build.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to run a <i>Build</i> type of build on this page
</td>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/build-new.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to run a <i>Build With New</i> type of build on this page
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/html.png" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to go directly to the TGP page template editing interface for this page
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/edit.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to edit the TGP page settings.  A window will appear where you will be able to edit all of the page settings.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/trash.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to delete this TGP page.  This will delete the TGP page from the database so it is no longer updated, but will not remove the actual generated TGP page from your server.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

In addition to running these functions on single TGP pages, you can also delete multiple pages at once.  To do this, put a check in the checkbox next to the
TGP pages you want to delete, then press the Delete button at the bottom of the page.

<b class="heading">Adding TGP Pages</b>

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
On some servers PHP has it's open_basedir setting configured so that PHP scripts can only write files in specific directories.  In shared hosting environments, this
setting is often configured in such a way that TGPX Server Edition will not be able to create TGP pages for sites other than the one it is installed on.  In these cases
you will need to have your server administrator adjust the open_basedir setting so that TGPX Server Edition can write to all of the directories that are for websites that
you own and want to generate TGP pages for.
</div>
<br />


To add a new TGP Page, access the TGP Pages &gt; Manage Pages function from the control panel menu.  Near the top of the page in the header
bar that reads "Manage TGP Pages" click on the <img src="../images/add.png" border="0" alt=""> icon.  This will display a popup 
window where you will be able to enter the information for the new page.  Each of the form fields are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap="nowrap">
<b>Path &amp; Filename</b>
</td>
<td>
Enter the full directory path and filename for the new TGP page.  With the Server Edition of TGPX you can enter any directory path on your server, which
allows you to create TGP pages for other sites on your server from one TGPX installation.  If this points to a directory that does not yet exist, you will
need to create the directory and set it's permissions to 777.  If this points to a file that already exists, the file should be deleted or have it's permissions
changed to 666; note that the existing file will be overwritten if you simply change it's permissions and do not rename it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Page URL</b>
</td>
<td>
Enter the full URL that corresponds to the value you entered in the Filename field.
</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Category</b>
</td>
<td>
Select a specific category for this page, or MIXED if you want to allow galleries and ads from all categories.  If you do select a specific category,
only galleries and ads from that category will be allowed to appear on the page.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap="nowrap">
<b>Build Order</b>
</td>
<td>
Enter a number to indicate the order in which this page will be built.  This value will automatically be filled in with the next available
position in the build order, but you can change it to any value.  Lower numbers indicate pages that will be built first, and larger numbers 
indicate pages that will be built last.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Tags</b>
</td>
<td>
You can use this field to specify tags for this page.  Tags are useful for grouping purposes so that you can tell TGPX to build only certain
pages based on the tag(s) they have set.  Tags must be at least 4 characters long and should be listed separated by spaces.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Lock this page</b>
</td>
<td>
Check this box if you do not want this page to be built using either of the 'Build All' page building functions.  If this box is checked, the page
will only be built when you click on the <img src="../images/build.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt=""> or <img src="../images/build-new.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="">
icons in the Manage Pages interface OR if you use the --override-lock option of the cron.php script.

<b class="heading">Editing a TGP Page<a name="edit"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To edit a TGP page you will first need to locate it through the <a href="#search">Manage Pages</a> interface.  When you locate the page you want to edit, click on the
<img src="../images/edit.png"> icon to bring up the page editing interface.  This interface is nearly identical to the page creation interface,
and has the same form fields with the same properties.  You can make the changes that you want, and then press the Update TGP Page button to save your changes.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Deleting a TGP Page<a name="delete"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To delete a TGP page you will first need to locate it through the <a href="#search">Manage Pages</a> interface.  When you locate the page you want to delete, click
on the <img src="../images/trash.png"> icon, which will ask you to confirm the deletion. 

<br />
<br />

You can also delete several pages at once by putting a check in the box next to the pages you want to delete, then pressing the Delete button at the bottom of the page.

<br />
<br />


<b class="heading">Page Quick Tasks<a name="tasks"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

From the Manage Pages interface you will be able to access the quick tasks functions which allow you to perform a search and replace on your pages.
To access the quick tasks interface click on the <img src="../images/tasks.png" border="0"> icon in the Manage Galleries interface.  A popup window will appear displaying
the search and replace function.

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
It is  very important to note that if you do a replacement in the Page URL it will also be necessary to do the same replacement in the Path &amp; Filename field
to ensure that the two values are correlated correctly.

<br />
<br />

Likewise, when doing a replacement in the Path &amp; Filename field, it <b>may</b> be necessary to do the same replacement in the Page URL value.  If the text you
are replacing appears in the Page URL, it will be necessary to run the replacement on that as well.
</div>

<br />

If you need to quickly search for and replace an item in your entire database of TGP pages, you can use this function.
For example, this can be used if you have decided that you want to move all of your archive pages from a directory named 
'old' to a directory named 'archive'.  To do this you would enter '/old/' in the Search For box and select Page URL for the Search Field.  
In the Replace With box enter '/archive/'.  You can now press the Search and Replace button and TGPX will automatically go through the each
of your TGP pages and replace each occurance of '/old/' with '/archive/'.  If you want to search for an empty value, use the special string
NULL in the Search For field.

<br />
<br />

You do need to be somewhat cautious when using this feature because it will locate the text you enter in the Search For box anywhere within
the field it is searching.  For example, if you search for 'html' in the Path &amp; Filename field and set it to replace with 'php' this could
cause a problem for pages that have a .shtml extension.  It would change those pages from .shtml to .sphp, which obviously is not correct.
