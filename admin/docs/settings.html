<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The General Settings interface allows you to configure the software options as you like.  There are a number of settings that you can adjust, and each of them 
is described in this section of the manual.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Basic Settings</b>

<ul>
<b>Document Root</b> - This is the full directory path to the root of your website where TGPX is installed.  For example, when you access http://www.yoursite.com/index.html
the index.html file is located in your Document Root folder.  TGPX will try to automatically set this value for you, so in most cases you do not need
to change this setting.<br /><br />

<b>TGPX URL</b> - This is the the base URL where TGPX is installed on your server<br /><br />

<b>Thumbnail URL</b> - This is the URL that points to the directory on your server where you want the TGPX generated preview thumbnails to be
stored.  This should point to an empty directory with 777 permissions that is located inside the Document Root.<br /><br />

<b>Page Permissions</b> - The file permissions to set on the generated TGP pages.
<br /><br />

<b>E-mail Address</b> - This is the e-mail address will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by TGPX<br /><br />
<b>E-mail Name</b> - This is the name that will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by TGPX<br /><br />
<b>E-mail Sender</b> - Choose the method that TGPX will use for sending emails.  In most cases you should leave this set to the default PHP mail() Function
option.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>PHP mail() Function</b> - TGPX will use PHP's built in mail() function for sending e-mail messages.<br />
<b>Sendmail</b> - TGPX will use sendmail on your server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that PHP is not running
in safe mode and the popen() function is not disabled.  You will need to enter the full path to sendmail in the text input box
after the drop down selection field.<br />
<b>SMTP Server</b> - TGPX will use a SMTP server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that the SMTP server has authorized your
server to send e-mail messages through it.  You will need to enter the hostname of the SMTP server in the input box after the drop
down selection field.
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<b>Date Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for date values<br /><br />
<b>Time Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for time values<br /><br />
<b>Timezone</b> - Select the timezone you are located in so that dates and times can be calculated properly<br /><br />
<b>Decimal Point</b> - The value to use for the decimal point in numbers<br /><br />
<b>Thousands Separator</b> - The value to use for the thousands separator in numbers<br /><br />

<b>Reset click, build, and used counters when permanent gallery is rotated from holding to approved</b> - If this option is checked, the click, used, and build counters will be reset
to 0 for permanent galleries that are rotated from the holding queue to the approved queue.  This is useful if you want permanent galleries to start fresh each time they are selected
for display.  If the counters are not reset, a permanent gallery that is selected for display more than once will continue to increment these counters.<br /><br />

</ul>

<b class="heading">Image Manipulation Settings</b>

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
To use the image cropping and resizing features of TGPX your sever will either need to have the PHP compiled with the GD extension or
have the ImageMagick command line tools installed and able to be used through PHP.  PHP cannot be running in safe mode or have the shell_exec
function disabled if you want to use the ImageMagick command line tools.
</div>

<ul>
<b>Image Library</b> - If available you will have the choice of using GD or ImageMagick for the image cropping and resizing features of the software.
In most cases ImageMagick will produce better looking images, so if it is available that is recommended.<br /><br />

<b>Bad Sized Uploaded Thumb</b> - This option specifies what should be done when a preview thumbnail is uploaded that does not meet the size requirements you have set.
The Reject option will reject the gallery submission and ask the user to resubmit.  The Automatically Crop option will have the software automatically resize and crop
the thumbnail to the correct size<br /><br />

<b>ImageMagick Arguments</b> - Enter the command line arguments to pass to ImageMagick when creating your preview thumbnails.  You can use this field to customize the sharpening, contrast,
brightness, etc that is applied to the preview thumbnails that are created.  A complete list of the available command line options and their descriptions can be found at the
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php" target="_blank">ImageMagick website</a>.  The default value for this field is:<br />
-modulate 110,102,100 -sharpen 1x1 -enhance<br /><br />

<b>JPEG Quality</b> - Set the quality to use for the JPEG preview thumbnails generated by TGPX.  This value can be any number from 0 to 100.  Larger numbers will
produce better looking images, but the filesize of the images will be larger.

<br /><br />

<b>Portrait Bias</b> - The bias to use for portrait oriented images (image height is greater than width) when automatically cropping them.  Center will crop the center of the
image, Top will crop from the top of the image, and Bottom will crop from the bottom of the image.

<br /><br />

<b>Landscape Bias</b> - The bias to use for landscape oriented images (image width is greater than height) when automatically cropping them.  Center will crop from the center of the
image, Left will crop from the left side of the image, and Right will crop from the right side of the image.

</ul>

<b class="heading">Gallery Submission Settings</b>

<ul>
<b>Global Submissions Per Day</b> - The maximum number of galleries that can be submitted per day.  Once this number has been reached, no further submissions will be accepted until the next day<br /><br />
<b>Submissions Per Person</b> - The maximum number of galleries a single person can submit per day.<br /><br />
<b>Description Length</b> - The minimum and maximum number of characters allowed in a gallery description<br /><br />

<b>Default Gallery Weight</b> - The default weight value assigned to newly submitted galleries<br /><br />
<b>Minimum Gallery Thumb Size</b> - Set the minimum thumbnail size that can appear on the gallery pages (in WxH format).  This setting only tells the software what size of images to look for on the gallery page, and does not have any affect on the size of thumbnails that you use on your TGP.<br /><br />
<b>Maximum Links Allowed</b> - The maximum number of links that can appear on submitted galleries, not including the links that point to the gallery content<br /><br />
<b>Permanent Holding Period</b> - The number of days to keep permanent galleries in the holding queue after they are displayed.  Once this time elapses, the galleries will be moved back to the Approved queue<br /><br />
<b>Submitted Holding Period</b> - The number of days to keep submitted galleries in the holding queue after they are displayed.  Once this time elapses, the galleries will be deleted from the database<br /><br />
<b>Submission Status</b>

<b>Allow user to submit the format (pictures or movies) of their gallery</b> - If this option is checked, the user will be able to select the format of their gallery when they submit.  If this is not

<b>Require that gallery content be hosted on same server as the gallery</b> - Check this to have the software check to make sure that the gallery content (full sized images or movies) is hosted on the same
                                                                              server as the gallery itself<br /><br />
