<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

Categories are one of the basic building blocks for your TGP and allow submitters and administrators to specify what category(ies) each gallery fits into.  Before you
can begin accepting gallery submissions you will need to setup at least one category.  This document describes how to manage your categories.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Viewing/Searching Categories<a name="search"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To view or search your currently configured categories, access the Settings &gt; Manage Categories function from the control panel menu.  This will display a page where you will be able to 
see the currently configured categories and search them if you wish.

<br />
<br />

In the table that displays the categories, you will find a couple of functions that you can run on a single category.  Each of those functions are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/edit.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to edit the category.  A window will appear where you will be able to edit all of it's settings.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/trash.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to delete this category.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

In addition to running these functions on single categories, you can also run the delete function on multiple categories at once.  To run the delete function, put a check in the checkbox next to the
categories you want to delete, then press the Delete button at the bottom of the page.

<br />
<br />

The search results will display a few different pieces of information about the gallery.  Each column of the search results is described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">

be activated and ready for galleries immediately.

<br />
<br />

<a name="default"></a>
<b class="heading">The Default Category</b>

<br />
<br />

Any time you add a new category you will notice that many of the form fields have been pre-filled for you.  This data is taken from the default category settings, which can be edited.
To edit the default category, access the Settings &gt; Manage Categories function from the control panel menu.  This will display your currently configured categories.  Near the top of the page in the header
bar that reads "Manage Categories" click on the <img src="../images/edit-large.png" border="0" alt=""> icon.  This will display a popup window where you will be able to edit the data
for the default category.

<br />
<br />

The default category settings are the same as when you add a new category, with th exception that you do not enter a category name.  The form fields described above have the same meaning
when editing the default category as they do when adding/editing a defined category.  Once you've got the settings configured how you want them, press the Save Default Settings button to 
record this information.

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
The default category is also used when you are importing galleries and you tell the import function to create a new category for any that are imported with the galleries but don't already exist.
The default category settings will be used for the new category(ies) that are created during the gallery import process.
