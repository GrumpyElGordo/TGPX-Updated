<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The template wizard will assist you in creating the necessary {galleries} functions to pull galleries from the database and will also generate the {foreach} function to
display each of the galleries on your page.  This document will cover how to use the template wizard.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Accessing the Template Wizard</b>

<br />
<br />

To access the template wizard use the TGP Pages &gt; Edit Templates function.  This will load the page where you edit your templates.  In the header bar of this page that
reads TGP Page Templates you can click on the <img src="../images/wizard.png" border="0"> icon to access the template wizard.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Basic Overview</b>

<br />
<br />

The template wizard is something that will help you to generate the {galleries} and {foreach} commands that you will need to use to pull galleries from the database and
display them on your page.  

<br />
<br />

For HTML templates, the wizard will not generate a complete template for you with all of the HTML code that you need for a full page.  It is designed to give you
the code you need for a specific section of galleries.  For example, if you want to quickly generate the template code necessary to display 20 thumbnail galleries on the
page, you can use the template wizard.  The code that the wizard creates will need to be inserted into your TGP page template code at the location where you want the
galleries to appear.

<br />
<br />

For RSS feed templates, the wizard will generate the complete template for you.  You will simply need to copy the entire generated template code and save it for the 
RSS feed template.  Make sure your RSS feed templates have a .xml, .rdf, or .rss file extension!

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
Remember, you are not limited to a single section of galleries per page; you can have as many sections as you want.  Therefore, you can use the wizard multiple times to
create all of the template code you will need for your page to pull galleries for each of the sections of galleries that you want to display on the page.

<b class="heading">General Options</b>

<br />
<br />

The General Options section of the template wizard will allow you to conifgure some basic settings for the template functions you will be generating.  Each of the settings
you can configure are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap="nowrap">
<b>Number of Galleries</b>
</td>
<td>
Enter the total number of galleries you would like to display in the section you are generating
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Display As</b>
</td>
<td>
Select how you would like the galleries displayed<br />
<b>Thumbnails</b> - This will generate some default HTML code to display thumbnail previews for the galleries<br />
<b>Text Links</b> - This will generate some default HTML code to display text links for the galleries 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap="nowrap">
<b>Display in Rows</b>
</td>
<td>
This is mainly useful when you are displaying the galleries as thumbnails and will tell the wizard to automatically
generate the HTML table code necessary to display the thumbnails in several rows.  For example, if you tell the wizard
to display 25 galleries and enter 5 galleries per row, this will generate an HTML table that will display the thumbnails
in a 5x5 table.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Type of Galleries</b>
</td>
<td>
This allows you to select the type(s) of galleries you would like displayed in this section.  You can select a percentage
of submitted and permanent galleries to display.  When you change the percentages, the number of each type will be displayed
in parenthesis after the type name.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<b>Mix Method</b>
</td>
<td>
If you select a mixed percentage of galleries for the <i>Type of Galleries</i> setting, you will be able to select how the
galleries are mixed together.<br />
<b>Random</b> - Permanent galleries will be placed at random locations within the submitted galleries.<br />
<b>Specific Interval</b> - Enter a number which indicates the interval at which galleries will be mixed.  For example, using 2 will place a permanent gallery after every 2nd submitted gallery.<br />
<b>Specific Locations</b> - Enter a comma seprated list of where you want the galleries placed.  For example, using 2,4,6,8 would place a permanent gallery after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th submitted gallery.<br />
